# File Management Platform

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust file management platform utilizing technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis. The platform will provide functionality for user authentication, file management, and background processing, allowing users to upload, view, and manage files seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using tokens to protect sensitive data.
- **File Management**: Upload, retrieve, and manage files with various functionalities:
  - List all files.
  - Change file permissions.
  - Generate thumbnails for images.
- **Background Processing**: Utilize Bull for background tasks to improve user experience and performance.

## Learning Objectives

Participants will gain hands-on experience and learn how to:
- Develop a RESTful API.
- Implement user authentication using best practices.
- Effectively manage data with MongoDB and Redis.
- Organize code into a maintainable structure.

## Project Requirements

- **Technologies**: Node.js, MongoDB, Redis.
- **Code Standards**: All code should adhere to ESLint rules to maintain quality and consistency.
- **Code Organization**: Code should be organized into multiple files and directories as necessary.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies are properly installed.

## API Endpoints

Define the following routes for file operations:
- **POST /upload**: Upload a new file.
- **GET /files**: List all uploaded files.
